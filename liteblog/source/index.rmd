In the dying days of 2024, a woman who should have been doing something useful like replaying the original Mass Effect trilogy for the n-th time instead decided to learn something about [litedown](https://yihui.org/litedown), [targets](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/), and [legendry](https://teunbrand.github.io/legendry/). This absurdity, which has absolutely no use case whatsoever and should be shunned by one and all, is the inevitable outcome of her poor decision making.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| results: "asis"
.blog <- readRDS("../_liteblog.rds")
.blog$write_post_list()
.blog$write_footer()
```
